RoleBinding
===========

RoleBinding references a Role, but not contain it.  It can reference any Role in the same namespace or in the global namespace.
It adds who information via Users and Groups and namespace information by which namespace it exists in.  RoleBindings in a given
namespace only have effect in that namespace (excepting the master namespace which has power in all namespaces).

BuildLog
========

BuildLog is the (unused) resource associated with the build log redirector

kind: BuildLog                                                        # string (kind of object, in CamelCase; cannot be updated)

List
====

List contains a list of Kubernetes resources to be applied.
DEPRECATED: Will be replaced with the direct Kubernetes list.

kind: List                                                            # string (kind of object, in CamelCase; cannot be updated)

DeploymentConfig
================

DeploymentConfig represents a configuration for a single deployment (represented as a
ReplicationController). It also contains details about changes which resulted in the current
state of the DeploymentConfig. Each change to the DeploymentConfig which should result in
a new deployment results in an increment of LatestVersion.

kind: DeploymentConfig                                                # string (kind of object, in CamelCase; cannot be updated)
