one ClusterPolicy document per namespace.

ClusterRoleBinding
==================

ClusterRoleBinding references a ClusterRole, but not contain it.  It can reference any ClusterRole in the same namespace or in the global namespace.
It adds who information via Users and Groups and namespace information by which namespace it exists in.  ClusterRoleBindings in a given
namespace only have effect in that namespace (excepting the master namespace which has power in all namespaces).

RoleBinding
===========

RoleBinding references a Role, but not contain it.  It can reference any Role in the same namespace or in the global namespace.
It adds who information via Users and Groups and namespace information by which namespace it exists in.  RoleBindings in a given
namespace only have effect in that namespace (excepting the master namespace which has power in all namespaces).

DeploymentConfig
================

DeploymentConfig represents a configuration for a single deployment (represented as a
ReplicationController). It also contains details about changes which resulted in the current
state of the DeploymentConfig. Each change to the DeploymentConfig which should result in
a new deployment results in an increment of LatestVersion.

kind: DeploymentConfig                                                # string (kind of object, in CamelCase; cannot be updated; see http://releases.k8s.io/v1.0.0/docs/api-conventions.md#types-kinds)
