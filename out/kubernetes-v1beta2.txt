Binding
=======

Binding ties one object to another - for example, a pod is bound to a node by a scheduler.

kind: Binding                                                         # string (kind of object, in CamelCase; cannot be updated)

DeleteOptions
=============

DeleteOptions may be provided when deleting an API object

kind: DeleteOptions                                                   # string (kind of object, in CamelCase; cannot be updated)

Endpoints
=========

Endpoints is a collection of endpoints that implement the actual service.  Example:
  Name: "mysvc",
  Subsets: [
    {
      Addresses: [{"ip": "10.10.1.1"}, {"ip": "10.10.2.2"}],
      Ports: [{"name": "a", "port": 8675}, {"name": "b", "port": 309}]
    },
    {
      Addresses: [{"ip": "10.10.3.3"}],
      Ports: [{"name": "a", "port": 93}, {"name": "b", "port": 76}]
    },
 ]

Pod
===

Pod is a collection of containers that can run on a host. This resource is created
by clients and scheduled onto hosts.

will answer requests sent through the proxy.
